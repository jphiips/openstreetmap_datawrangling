The map area I chose to explore for this project is Germantown, TN. Germantown is a town located adjacent to Memphis, TN, and I bought a home there two years ago. Since moving to Germantown, I have really enjoyed exploring the area and seeing the various amenities (parks, trails, restaurants) the town has to offer. For that reason, I thought it would be fun to use the town for this project.
